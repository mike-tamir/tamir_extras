    "## Curse of dimensionality walkthrough\n",
    "This notebook will help to develop intuitions about a phenomena called the \"curse of dimensionality\"\n",
    "- As dimension number increases, traditional intuitions about \"closeness\" and \"volume\" associated with 1, 2, and 3 dimensions tend to break down\n",
    "- One way to think of this is that as dimensionality increases, distances functions seem to lose their ability to distinguish closeness.  \n",
    "\t- The practical effect of this is that the distances between sample points seem to all become equally far apart as dimension increases.\n",
    "- A second practical result of the curse of dimensionality is that for high dimension, \"most of the volume\" of a high dimensional figure (e.g. a hyper-cube) will be located at the margins.\n",
    "- Specifically, in this exercise, we will walk through a sequence of \"hyper-cubes\" of increasing dimensionality, removing a doughnut hole with 90% of the length.\n",
    "\t- We will see that even though we are removing doughnut holes that have 90% of the edge length, as **d** grows large, most of the volume will lie in the margins."
